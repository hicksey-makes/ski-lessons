# Ski Lessons App

**An app to book a ski\snowboard lesson with preferred instructor (built using Bootstrap and Create React App).**

## Implementation
* Single page application: one index.html file, whereby Javascript rewrites the content based on the url.
* Create React App sets up the build system (Webpack) and handles configuration.
* Create React App handles development vs production versions.
* Served by the Netlify serverless platform *(www.netlify.com)*.

## Steps Involved
* Use node.js to install create-react-app
* Use git for version control.
* Use a webserver provided by webpack throughout development. 
* Use reactDOM.render() to render React's virtual DOM to the HTML's.
* Build components and import them to the app component. 
* Render the App component in index.js.
* State variables used to track/update lesson preferences. 

## Next Steps
* Create about page for the three instructors using React Router.
* Integrate checkout functionality.
